# my database webapp made in flask.

## what was the purpose 

the purpose of this project was to see my ablity to link a webapp to a database which was quite succesfull 

## how to install flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/)

## how is it used

the admin sigin in is ssn 1 and password 1 which gives access to the admin dashboard. the database can now edited and viewed. users can be added and removed by inputting all the boxes on the web page 
the rest of the webapp pages will explain what you have to do.

## database

the database is accessed using sqlalchemy which connects to the app.py file with get post systems

## validation 

validation is limited due to time but the database will roll back if a user is added that does not meet the requirements.

## safety

the admin page can be accesed by typing /admin at the end making it completely insecure. if i wanted to make this website fully functional this oversite would need to be fixed 

## features i added later on

i added the ability to update a user which will only update the part of the user that you want to update making it a faster and better way that deleting and readding a user
